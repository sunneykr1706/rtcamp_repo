# rtcamp_repo
This project is made by me for a comapany winc.com in my four month in-office internship . I want to submit this project because it uses basic crud application. It uses shopify api for fetching the data from its api. In this i uses xampp localhost server , I just want to say sorry becuase i am not using live server , bascically i dont have any idea about how to use it , but under your guidence i will definetely learn it . I will also share the working video of my project in tht video it gets the data from the my sql table and showing in our website and helps user to submtting the form. 
What is the working of my project?
Bascically, my project helps user to give his/her mouth taste about the wine and we will recommend some of our wine which you can see in the website. 
ALgorithm:-

Their basic demand is to concatenate all the selected input that is given by user and try to find the product which has the same tag that is of the product. This is done by me very easily.

Api calling:-

Api calling is something which i love the most . So, in this project the main role is of API . What we do is we call the tags associated with the product using api calling .
and once i get all the product tags then i concatenate them and then match with the derired input of user.

Problems i faced :-

My api calling skill is too good actually i love to play with api. But , i faced problem while calling the data from database because it is first time i making somthing . I feeel very special at every single point when my code gets corrected. The main problem i faced in making form . Bascically , client demand is to show the data one by one and my all data  come in a single page then i use satckoverflow and then i change the <div> blocks because the indentation is not good i messup all the things . Then i clean my code and do proper indentation and it will really help.
  I am not able to provide the link becuase i dont have credit card abd heroku wants the credit card detail for giving the database server because i am 20 years , i applied for credit card in slice but they hold my kyc and giving any output . In my family, no one is using credit i havn't used it earlier so i don;t wan to take the risk of money loosing of my dad account . I hoper rtccap team understand my problem . 
  
  Outcome:-
  
  After doing this project ,i am very much confident in php and its crud application . First time using shopify api , I feel like this is how amazon works.
  
  Thank you.
